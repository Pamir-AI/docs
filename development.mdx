</Info>

To start work on your distiller apps, fork/clone repo here https://github.com/Pamir-AI/DistillerSDK

We suggest to use venv, once you cd into the repo

```bash 
python -m venv venv
./venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .[prod]
```

### Troubleshooting

You might run into issue like *libcamera* or *pykms* missing from venv, this is due to they are installed into default python3 path.

```bash
cp -r /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/libcamera venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
cp -r /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pykms venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
```
