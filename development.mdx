  **Prerequisite** example run on Python 3.11.2
</Info>

### Python SDK
To start work on your distiller apps, fork/clone repo here https://github.com/Pamir-AI/DistillerSDK

We suggest to use venv (we preinstall all of them on the device at this default path /home/distiller/DistillerSDK/venv)

```bash 
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[hardware]
```

### Distiller Linux Image
Will be released soon.


### Troubleshooting

You might run into issue like *libcamera* or *pykms* missing from venv, this is due to they are installed into default python3 path.

```bash
cp -r /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/libcamera venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
cp -r /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pykms venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
```
